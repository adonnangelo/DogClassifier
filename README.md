# DogClassifier
Udacity Data Science Capstone Project

# Project Motivation
This project's goal is to detect humans and dogs in images, and to predict the dog breed most similar to those subjects. Several CNNs were developed to explore model architectures, and to eventually create a classifying algorith.

# Libraries 
The following libraries were used in this project:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn.datasets
- glob
- random
- cv2
- keras.applications.resnet50
- keras.preprocessing
- tqdm
- PIL
- keras.layers
- keras.optimizers
- keras.callbacks
- extract_bottleneck_features

# Files
dog_app.ipynb - main notebook that houses the final classification algorithm

# Datasets
Data for this project was supplied by Udacity. There are two data sets, one containing dog images and one containing human images. 

# Results
This project was successful in creating a dog breed classification model using VVG19 architecture. For a more in depth look at the results please see the following blog post: https://medium.com/@andrewdonnangelo/dog-breed-classification-4e67ab309d23
